Importance of Community learning environment</span>
      </h1>
      <div>
        This blog is being written by a very passionate introvert so you how much important the community learning environment is.
        Even though it is true that extrovertism and introvertism don't come naturally to anyone and are determined by one's environment,
        I have been a secret introvert throughout my life, I can play being an extrovert so good that it is almost an eye wash
        but staying unemployed during and after covid has taught me that community learning environments brings out the best of all of us no matter how much we disagree
        The forced pressure to survive and excel has been the sole reasons homo sapiens are the largest species on Earth, think about it
        we all have that gene though is getting dormant day by day.
