Cricket in UAE, England and USA</span>
      </h1>
      <div>
        Cricket in UAE, England and USA have been in talks for almost an year now as cricket is trying to expand itself globally.
        But there are some major issues with this approach, cricket matches in these countries often become a subject to the conditions like dew, overcast conditions and sand storms
        and the last major world cricketing events like CT2017, WC2019, WTC2021, T20WC2021 and the ongoing AsiaCup have been nothing but mere proofs of it.
        Whether it be interruptions due to rain in England, one sided matches due to dew in UAE or storms in the USA all of it can be bad for the publicity of the game
        because even the smallest format of cricket lasts more than a football game. Now you'll say that these things that they are first world countries 
        so they generate more revenues. True but keep in mind the fact the cricket draws its major viewership from the south asian countries, therefore blowing 
        out your original audience for the sake of some future audience doesn't seems correct and cynical.
        Or if ICC really want best of both worlds it can slightly alter it way how cricket it executed in these nations
        for eg Extra days could be reserved before hand for rain and storm affected nations, for the dew factor-make teams play equal no. of overs with and without dew
